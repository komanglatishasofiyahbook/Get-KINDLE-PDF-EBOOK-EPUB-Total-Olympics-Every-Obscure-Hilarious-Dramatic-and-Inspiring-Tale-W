Title: Love this book.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2021
Review: This book is so well written that even if you don‚Äôt know the athlete the author chronicles, you are swept up in the story by his humor and knowledge. I keep the book on my coffee table and while I‚Äôm making drinks, my friends are usually happily perusing this book. I definitely think people should get it before the summer Olympics. It‚Äôs a great read!

Title: This Book Takes The Gold!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2021
Review: This is the book with the bold subtitle, ‚ÄúEvery Obscure, Hilarious, Dramatic, & Inspiring Tale Worth Knowing.‚Äù Playing armchair quarterback, I thought of more than a few people who had been left out of the book. Yet, I am sure we all could dredge up a memory or two about someone or some event not listed. What‚Äôs important is that author Jeremy Fuchs has compiled a fascinating book filled to the brim with stories and anecdotes I had never heard.

The book is laid out beautifully, with plenty of pictures ‚Äì both black-and-white and color ‚Äì of Olympic heroes. Rather than take a chronological journey, Mr. Fuchs has opted to create large categories and find places for all those who earned a story in his book. The chapter titles alone are enticing, sure to draw in the curious: Forgotten History, Legends, Wild and Strange, Firsts, Discontinued Sports, and Forgotten Heroes. The Results and Stats section in the back is an added treat of different bits of knowledge, from lists of gold medal winners to the names of all the torch lighters.

Although athletes from other countries are included, the book primarily features those from America (some of the reasoning behind that is probably due to the number of medals won, far more to Americans than any other country). The book is over 300 pages long, and the author has successfully filled every one of those pages with revealing stories. Even better, most of the stories are only a couple of pages long, making it easy to read a few stories and then set the book down for later. Highly recommended. Five stars.

My thanks to NetGalley and Workman Publishing Company for a complimentary electronic copy of this book.

Title: Olympic champs, forgotten heroes, the wild and strange and more
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2021
Review: Every four years, the Olympics take center stage and mesmerize much of the world. Some of the best known athletes in the world were Olympic champs. The feats of Michael Phelps, Nadia Comaneci, Jesse Owens and Usain Bolt are well known.

But author Jeremy Fuchs writes that "for every story that has been ingrained into the sports' fans consciousness others have slipped through time."

Fuchs recounts some of the unforgotten history of the Olympics in the first 40 pages and then covers many of the legends in 78 pages, the book's longest chapter. He also delves into the lesser known athletes and their achievements. He presents these stories in four chapters: Wild and Strange, Firsts, Discontinued Sports and Forgotten Heroes.

In the Wild and Strange category, you can read about the Wildest Race of All Time (the 1908 Marathon), The Cheating Marathon (where rat poison was used) and Fowl Play at the 1928 Olympics.

Included among the Firsts are Alice Coachman, the first African American woman to win gold; Margaret Abbot, the first female American victor; Eddie Eagan, the first two-sport star, and many others.

Among the Forgotten Heroes are Billy Mills, Paavo Nurmi, Johnny Weissmuller and Evelyn Ashford.

Some of the discontinued sports include the rope climb, underwater swim, live pigeon shooting and plunge for depth events.

Fuchs unearths plenty of interesting stories, most of them no more than two pages. The book is heavily illustrated and easy to read. This is an enjoyable lead-up to the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo.

Title: Such a Fun Book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2021
Review: This book combines two of my favorite things: random, fun facts and the Olympics. To me, it's the perfect combination. While I haven't read the whole thing yet, I have enjoyed what I've read so far. Mostly, I've been skipping around, reading what looks interesting.

The great thing about the book is that each story is fairly short, generally two pages at the most. There are pictures included with many of the stories. It can be read straight through, skimmed to find stories that sound interesting, or read based on a category that interests you. The chapters are "Forgotten History," "Legends," "Wild and Strange," "Firsts," "Discontinued Sports," and "Forgotten Heroes."

One of the great things about this book is that it includes a mix of the familiar and the more obscure or lesser known people and events. For example, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt, Simone Biles, and the "Miracle on Ice" 1980 USA Men's Ice Hockey Team are all included in the book. It also includes information about the fight that broke out between the Hungarian and Soviet water polo teams at the 1956 games, the time when teams attempted to intentionally lose badminton matches at the 2012 games, and information about discontinued sports, such as rifle dueling and rope climbing.

In reading through what other reviewers have written, I see that some have complained that there are too many people from the United States and not enough representation from other countries. While there are more U.S. athletes than athletes from other countries, there are definitely some great stories from other countries. Overall, this is a fun, informative book for any fan of the Olympics.

Updated on September 11, 2021: I did find at least one fact mistake. On page 291, it says that Ray Ewry's highest standing long jump was 11 feet, 4 7/8 inches. It then says that the world record for the running long jump is 12 feet, 3 inches. The world record for the running long jump is definitely higher than that. I participated in track in high school, and I definitely knew some people who did better than that in the running long jump. My guess is that the world record is probably closer to 30 feet. It's a big mistake, so I'm tempted to take one star off, but the rest of the book was really good. I'll let the one mistake pass, even if it is a big mistake.
